Amazon Web Services recently released the Firecracker Virtual Machine Monitor
(VMM) built on top of the Linux KVM subsystem, which is optimized for
lightweight, container-like "microVMs". This session dives deep into the
architecture of the firecracker-containerd project, which aims to allow
portability between standard OCI container images and the larger container
ecosystem with Firecracker microVMs. Topics covered will include the standard
containerd architecture with the reference OCI runtime (runc), challenges
adapting containers into microVMs, and the firecracker-containerd suite.

In this session, we'll explore the different Linux primitives that are commonly
used in implementing container runtimes. We'll learn about the Linux primitives
that underlie container runtimes like Docker, including cgroups, namespaces,
and union filesystems. We'll see how Docker uses these primitives, and how the
OCI standard makes it possible to customize how your containers run. We'll also
discuss alternative container runtimes like CRI-O, rkt, and systemd-nspawn and
what makes them different. This will be an interactive session with a live demo
and open questions.

Docker containers are commonly regarded as powerful and portable runtime
environments for Linux code, but Docker also offers support for running Windows
Server applications in containers. 

In this talk, we'll discuss what containers are and why you'd use them, how they
work on Windows, and how Windows containers compare to Linux containers.
