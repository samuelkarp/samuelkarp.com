In this session, we'll explore the different Linux primitives that are commonly
used in implementing container runtimes. Starting with Docker containers and
moving down through the stack, we'll cover containerd, runc, and the underlying
Linux primitives like cgroups, namespaces, and union filesystems. We'll also
discuss alternative container runtimes like CRI-O, rkt, and systemd-nspawn and
what makes them different. This will be an interactive session with a live demo
and open questions.
