Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouting program of the
Boy Scouts of America (BSA). A Scout who attains this rank is called an Eagle
Scout or Eagle. Since its introduction in 1911, the Eagle Scout rank has been
earned by more than 2 million young men. The title of Eagle Scout is held for
life, thus giving rise to the phrase "Once an Eagle, always an Eagle."

Requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges and demonstrating Scout
Spirit through the Boy Scout Oath and Law, service, and leadership. This
includes an extensive service project that the Scout plans, organizes, leads,
and manages. Eagle Scouts are presented with a medal and a badge that visibly
recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Additional recognition can be
earned through Eagle Palms, awarded for completing additional tenure,
leadership, and merit badge requirements.
